# Attendance-System-using-Face-Recognition-in-Python
In this project, I've used the OpenCV and face recognition library to read and identify the faces through the WebCam. This project is consists of two folders('Images' and 'Records') and one program file. The 'Images' folder contains the images of the employees or students. In my case, I've kept some of my friend's photos as an example. You can place other images here as your need.  The program file reads faces through the WebCam and if a face matches with the photos from the 'Images' folder, then it will create a CSV file with the current date. For instance, a CSV file will be created like this: record_10_03_2022 for 10th March 2022.
